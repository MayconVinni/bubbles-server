# bubbles-server

This is my first time creating a Discord clone and using
[`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/sqlite3.html).

<!--To interact with the server, you can download
[`bubbles-client`](https://github.com/MayconVinni/bubbles-client).-->

In the future I will be making a `bubbles-client`.

You can easily change the value from something in `constants.py`.
