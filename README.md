# bubbles-server

This is my first time creating a Discord clone and using
[`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/sqlite3.html)
to create databases.

<!--To interact with the server, you can download
[`bubbles-client`](https://github.com/MayconVinni/bubbles-client).-->

This project is not finished and can have bugs.
Read `TODO.md` to see what's been implemented.
